# docker-alpine-freepbx
A docker container for FreePBX built upon the Alpine-based Linuxserver.io lsiobase nginx container

This is a work in progress...

Current status:
- Working on satisfying as many depencencies as possible for Asterisk.
- Installed as many as possible from Alpine's own repositories
- Fetching those dependencies that cannot be provided by Alpine from Github and Sourceforge
